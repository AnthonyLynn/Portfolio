A portfolio website made by Anthony Lynn. Displays latest projects and an openai chat bot recruiters can ask questions to.

Please contact me or open an issue if you have any feedback, thank you!

**Technologies**

The websites design was planned in Figma, featuring a laptop, tablet, and mobile resolutions; figma design also includes theme colors.
While initially built with Vite, it's now made with Next.js to handle frontend and backend seamlessly.
It includes React.js as it's front-end framework and TypeScript for quality code with strict typechecking.
Routing and 3rd party API calls to OpenAI's API is handled through Next.js.
